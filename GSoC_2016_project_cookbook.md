# A Shogun cookbook

All GSoC 2016 students will work on this project jointly, next to their main project.

### Description
This project is about bringing a new Shogun cookook to life. This puts together a year of work on Shogun's [meta language](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Example_Generation), and our [cookbook](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/doc/sphinx) for a sphinx-based API documentation system. The goal is to have API example that cover all target languages and all algorithms, in a form that looks like [this](http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/).



### Details
As you see in the screenshot above, there will be code listings for all target languages (selected through a tab), and some text explaining the interface. The project is about transforming our [Python API examples](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular) into Meta-language examples, which are automatically translated into executable code listings. In a second step, we can write some English text that explains the API in a minimal way, referencing the snippets in the code.

### Waypoints and initial work
To start, you can:

 * Check the README of our [cookbook](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/doc/cookbook) and try to run it locally.
 * Add an example for an existing Python example

Once all Python examples are translated to meta examples, we aim to completely remove the old ones. In a next step, all generated code listings should be embedded into our CMake build.

### Optional
We also aim to remove all static interface's examples and tests. Those have to migrated to the new system too.

### Why this is cool
Shogun's main strength is the support of a large number of target languages. This project is a great showcase for this killer feature. You will touch many of Shogun's ML algorithms, learn about our build system, SWIG and how to manage  multiple computer languages in a project. As most of the brain work is already done, this should be a fun opportunity for students to get to know other parts of Shogun during GSoC, and to create the community feeling of working on a project together.
